# Build-Java-Projects
To see the core Java concepts in action.
To understand the ideas and know how to apply them in an application.


I wanted to get better at understanding and applying Java design and OOP.

So, the Java projects that I work on help me to grasp OOP concepts, apply OOP in an actual program,
practice developing their applications by band, and debug their code and overcome challenges.

```
Projects:

1. An email administration application (DONE)
2. A student database application (DONE)
3. A new bank account application

```
